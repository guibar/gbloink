Gbloink!
========

*Gbloink! ... in the browser!*

This is a fork from Phil John's Gbloink.

The aim was to practice my typescript skills on something concrete and play a bit.

Just run tsc at the root of the project and load index.html in a browser.

## Done
- Converted to typescript
- Put balls on one canvas and blocks on a different one
- Played with spatial index [rbush](https://github.com/mourner/rbush) to find quickly which block will be hit if any. 

## To Do
- Try a different MIDI library like Midi.js
