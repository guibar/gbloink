Gbloink!
========

*Gbloink! ... in the browser!*

This is a fork from Phil John's Gbloink.

The aim was to practice my typescript skills on something concrete and play a bit.

Just run tsc at the root of the project and load index.html in a browser.

## Done
- Converted to typescript
- Put balls on one canvas and blocks on a different one
  

## To Do
- Play with a spatial index like [rbush](https://github.com/mourner/rbush) to make collision handling with blocks more efficient.
- Try a different MIDI library like Midi.js
